# Portfolio checklist

- [ ] Does my UX portfolio convey the range of skills that the job description outlines?
    
- [ ] Does this case study go beyond deliverables?
    
- [ ] Does this case study explain not just what I did but why I did it?
    
- [ ] Is there a good balance of text and images?
    
- [ ] Could I replace any of the text with images or visuals?
    
- [ ] Is the text readable and skim-able?
    
- [ ] Could I further break up text with smaller paragraphs, bulleted lists, and headlines?
    
- [ ] Do I make use of varying text sizes to help create hierarchy of information on each page?
    
- [ ] Are some details better suited to discuss in an interview versus be included in the case study or portfolio document?
    
- [ ] Does it feel overwhelming or too long?

### Personal note

This was a very special project as it had an impact on my personal perspective on design. It has taught me to try and approach any design problems beyond what is presented and how different areas may be connected e.g. consider the physical side instead of digital only, different industries applying design processes etc. In addition, the emphasis on content strategy have organically affected my following projects and career growth to be more strategy and content-first focused.

As a unexpected bonus, I also had the opportunity to attend my very first business trip with my colleague.

### Overview

When designing user experiences, it is common practice for designers to focus on the visuals when creating interactions. As technology continues to grow rapidly, more sophisticated products are entering the market and creating new experiences for consumers. These products are allowing us to use our 5 human senses to interact with its multimodal interfaces (e.g. voice, touch, gesture etc.), and therefore creating a multisensory experience.

### Sharing our research with the community

Our goal was to create a general presentation about sound within 3 months. We will then share our findings at a [UX Playground community event](https://www.meetup.com/UX-Playground-The-User-Experience-Meetup-for-Londoners/events/264396344/) and also at [Brandweek 2019](https://www.brandweekistanbul.com/en/) conference in Istanbul. The following are key areas we focused on for our research:

- What is the purpose of sound in our everyday lives
- How does it impact our behaviour and perceptions as consumers
- How do brands use sound to enhance their customersâ€™ experience

### Team

Natalie Man, UX Designer

Chakib Labidi, Senior UX Design Consultant, UX Playground founder

Jasmina Jambresic, UX Designer, News UK

### Sound is everywhere

For this exploratory project, sound is a overwhelmingly complex topic. Before we started our research, I created a mind map in Miro to capture our own questions and thoughts, and to identify how different industries use sound. This helped us to consider some of the following:

- What do we want the presentation to cover?
- The areas we focus on should not be too narrow and specific
- The audience we present to should be able to easily relate to the topic e.g. in relation to their everyday life
- Focus on areas that allows us to create sufficient content for the presentation within the time constraints
- Our personal hobbies and interest and how sound may have impacted our experiences

After reviewing the mind map, we conducted our research and documented our findings in Google Docs. For each link I find, I would put them into the relevant category e.g. environment, game design, brands, music etc., and provide a short summary to highlight any important points that were relevant to the topic. This helps to provide a quick visual summary when I meet with my team for progress updates and also a good reference for our work later on.

We also did some qualitative research where Jasmina provided a short diary on travelling in London and her hometown in Sarajevo, Bosnia. Chakib also provided short video clips of his travels showing the sounds he hears at different places e.g. security gate at Charles de Gaulle airport in Paris and a traffic light crossing in Madrid. As an analysis activity, it was very interesting to distinguish sounds that are man-made versus nature.

\[jasmina diary imageâ€¦maybe a clip or screenshot of chakibâ€™s clips\]

Personally, it made me realise that any environment or activity we are involved in, all sounds are constantly competing for our attention. Additionally, I feel many of us probably do not realise how we subconsciously select what sounds to process as a way of navigating and learning about our environment and the things we do.

### Making it digestible

\[google sheet img\] (we later shortlisted links and categorised them into the three areas covered in the presentation)

~~\- Exploratory and open topic; very complex topic~~

\- Scientific research papers provided more insights and depth to general research - it provides a clearer understanding why certain things are designed a certain way

\- A mixture of physical and digital

\- Document own thoughts/questions - they are very useful to create a structure for slide prep and a focus on what we are trying to achieve. In general this method is also good for writing

~~\- Put relevant research under each section of the structure~~

\- Collaborating with someone makes research more fun and interesting - it helps you to think outside of the box and notice things you havenâ€™t before

~~\- Cite and source every relevant research and summarise why they are relevant~~

\- During review, prepare speaker notes for each piece of research that will be potentially used for the talk

~~\- Personal hobbies and interest can greatly add to research if it is relevant~~

\- Organising research early saves pain and headache when it gets reviewed later
