### Personal note

This was a very special project as it had an impact on my personal perspective on design. It has taught me to try and approach any design problems beyond what is presented and how different areas may be connected e.g. consider the physical side instead of digital only, different industries applying design processes etc. In addition, the emphasis on content strategy have organically affected my following projects and career growth to be more strategy and content-first focused.

As a unexpected bonus, I also had the opportunity to attend my very first business trip with my colleague.

### Overview

When designing user experiences, it is common practice for designers to focus on the visuals when creating interactions. As technology continues to grow rapidly, more sophisticated products are entering the market and creating new experiences for consumers. These products are allowing us to use our 5 human senses to interact with its multimodal interfaces (e.g. voice, touch, gesture etc.), and therefore creating a multisensory experience.

### Sharing our research with the community

Our goal was to create a general presentation about sound within 3 months. We will then share our findings at a [UX Playground community event](https://www.meetup.com/UX-Playground-The-User-Experience-Meetup-for-Londoners/events/264396344/) and also at [Brandweek 2019](https://www.brandweekistanbul.com/en/) conference in Istanbul. The following are key areas we focused on for our research:

- What is the purpose of sound in our everyday lives
- How does it impact our behaviour and perceptions as consumers
- How do brands use sound to enhance their customersâ€™ experience

### Sound is everywhere

For this exploratory project, sound is a overwhelmingly complex topic. Before we started our research, I created a mind map in Miro to capture our own questions and thoughts, and to identify how different industries use sound. This helped us to consider some of the following:

- What do we want the presentation to cover?
- The areas we focus on should not be too narrow and specific
- The audience we present to should be able to easily relate to the topic e.g. in relation to their everyday life
- Focus on areas that allows us to create sufficient content for the presentation within the time constraints
- Our personal hobbies and interest and how sound may have impacted our experiences

After reviewing the mind map, we conducted our research and documented our findings in Google Docs. For each link I find, I would put them into the relevant category e.g. environment, game design, brands, music etc., and provide a short summary to highlight any important points that were relevant to the topic. This helps to provide a quick visual summary when I meet with my team for progress updates and also a good reference for our work later on.

We also did some qualitative research where Jasmina provided a short diary on travelling in London and her hometown in Sarajevo, Bosnia. Chakib also provided short video clips of his travels showing the sounds he hears at different places e.g. security gate at Charles de Gaulle airport in Paris and a traffic light crossing in Madrid. As an analysis activity, it was very interesting to distinguish sounds that are man-made versus nature.

Personally, it made me realise that any environment or activity we are involved in, all sounds are constantly competing for our attention. Additionally, I feel many of us probably do not realise how we subconsciously select what sounds to process as a way of navigating and learning about our environment and the things we do.
