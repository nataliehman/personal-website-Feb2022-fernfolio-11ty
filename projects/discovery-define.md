## Overview

This page covers my work on research, analysis and planning. There are also samples where I used generative AI as part of my process like research.

## Content strategy: planning for course content required for launching a UX course

For the development of a design course offered by UX Playground, I was part of a team redesigning its previous format to support online learning. In the early phases of the project, my team and I reviewed the existing curriculum to assess what content could be reused and what new content was needed for the new format. By considering business goals and user needs, our review helped create a content plan. This plan provided a useful reference to understand the tasks required to complete development and launch the redesigned design course.

## Data analysis: reporting on community event performances

When UX Playground started running online events via Zoom, I analysed the event data collected to learn about the demographics of the community and their engagement levels during the sessions. I compiled my analysis of metrics like attendance numbers, location of attendees, and chat participation into a reporting deck. This allowed the team to review performance for each event and compare metrics between different topic areas covered. The analysis provided insights to optimise future community events.

## Data analysis: identifying success UX metrics for a design course

I did a small activity to learn about how to identify potential UX metrics for projects. One framework I discovered was a combination of [HEART and PULSE integrated into a GSM matrix](https://measuringu.com/heart-framework/). I applied this onto UX Playground's design course to identify potential success metrics based on feedback collected from the participant survey. Generally, businesses collect overwhelming amounts of data and I find the simple framework to be a useful for strategic planning.

## Journey mapping and personas: streamlining an event speaker management process

UX Playground frequently hosted events featuring guest speakers. To help manage resources, my team and I created journey maps covering the end-to-end speaker management process. We developed personas to identify the various roles and responsibilities involved, as well as touchpoints for communicating key information between stakeholders. This activity clarified expectations between the team and event partners, resulting in an optimised speaker management process.

## Secondary research: competitor analysis and market research of UX design courses to inform course development.

To inform the development of UX Playground's new online UX design course, I conducted market research and competitor analysis of other courses to gather insights into their teaching methods, durations, prices and customer feedback. The analysis provided useful references in helping my team to determine the appropriate pricing, optimal duration and effective teaching approach for our new course.

## Secondary research: leveraging generative AI for secondary research on "Sound and AI" at Capgemini's Level Up event

At UX Playground, me and my team had the opportunity to speak for [Capgemini's 'Level Up' event](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7114600725510254593/?updateEntityUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afs_updateV2%3A%28urn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A7114600725510254593%2CFEED_DETAIL%2CEMPTY%2CDEFAULT%2Cfalse%29), with the topic theme focused on 'generative AI'. Based on the success of our [previous research presentation](http://localhost:8080/projects/exploring-sound-in-user-experience-design-for-brand-week-istanbul/) on sound design in user experience, we decided to explore how AI could enhance our secondary research process for this follow-up presentation. The project was a great opportunity for us to explore different AI tools and gain valuable insights into current AI capabilities and limitations for design research.

Its answers were then collated in FigJam, and compiled key insights directly from the provided sources based on their relevance to our research goals.</figcaption>

## Secondary research: thematic analysis for article topics

The UX Playground team wanted to publish a series of articles on multisensory design and technology as a new community initiative. Having previously compiled research findings into spreadsheets and databases (Google Sheets and Airtable), I used this opportunity to explore research tools like Userbit to better support data analysis. The tool enabled thematic analysis of data, allowing me to efficiently extract meaningful insights for creating articles. The tagging feature also streamlined collaboration with my team. We could strategically plan and organise recurring themes emerging from the research to inform our content roadmap.
