### Overview

I wanted a place where I can share additional work without the constraints of a formal case study format. I hope this provides further insights into my creativity and problem-solving process as I grow further into my career.

### Event data analysis and reporting

When UX Playground started running events online, I analysed the event data collected from Zoom to learn about the demographics of the community, and how engaged people were during the event. I compiled the data into a reporting deck for the team to review event performance and how they compare based on the topic covered.

### Identifying UX metrics for a design course

I did small activity to learn about how to identify potential UX metrics for projects.  I used UX Playground's Project UX course as the example to identify how to measure success based on feedback collected from the participant survey. One framework I discovered was Google HEART but I found a more simplified framework, which I felt it can be useful for future projects or as reference for strategic planning.

### Journey mapping and personas for event speaker management

### Creating a storyboard to explain 'UX' for a design course

It was to explain what 'User Experience' involves and how it's applied in our daily lives (I used cake baking as the example).</figcaption>

### Using generative AI for storyboarding

Here we reviewed the different AI images generated from Midjourney and did a collective vote on which style to use (our preference was the first group from the left).</figcaption>

### Using AI for research

![Using Perplexity to efficiently do research](/static/img/design-journey-highlights/ai-sound-research.png) <figcaption>At UX Playground, we were invited to speak for a Capgemini 'Level Up' event and the topic theme was about 'Generative AI'. From our previous sound research, we decided to do a second part but including AI as part of the research. Here, we used Perplexity to help us efficiently do secondary research.</figcaption>

### Ideation sketches from a design sprint

### Systems flow diagrams for a complex campaign management process

Feedback from my team did highlight steps that I wasn't aware of, which further help me understand the importance of collaborating with different teams.</figcaption>

### Content strategy and planning for course development
