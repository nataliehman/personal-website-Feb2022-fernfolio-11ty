## Overview

This page mostly showcase work where I'm exploring ideas and visualising complex system processes. There are also samples where I used generative AI as part of my process like storyboarding.

## Flow diagrams:  mapping a complex campaign management process into system flow diagrams

![Visualising the campaign management process via system flow diagrams](/static/img/work-samples/flow-diagrams-system-feedback.png) <figcaption>My attempt in visualising how my team manages the full client campaign management process. Feedback from my team did highlight steps that I wasn't aware of, which helped me understand the importance of collaborating with different teams.</figcaption>

## Sketching: design sprint activity exploring ideas on how to engage with a community

## Storyboarding: describing 'UX' for the intro of a design course

![Storyboard for a course activity](/static/img/work-samples/storyboard-course-activity.png) <figcaption>A storyboard I created for a Project UX course activity. It was to explain what 'User Experience' involves and how it's applied in our daily lives (I used cake baking as an example).</figcaption>

## Storyboarding: using generative AI to create images

Here we reviewed the different AI images generated from Midjourney and did a collective vote on which style to use (our preference was the first group from the left).</figcaption>

## Wireframing: exploring data visualisation ideas for ad campaign management

![Exploration of different ideas via wireframing by analysing competitor dashboards](/static/img/work-samples/dashboard-wireframes.png) <figcaption>As part of the dashboard redesign project, me and my time explored competitor dashboards and analysed the design of their dashboards. We also explored what data our team needs for efficient ad campaign reporting for our clients.</figcaption>
